          In the above example, we have used three predefined methods main(),
          print(), and max(). We have used these methods directly without
          declaration because they are predefined. The print() method is a method
          of PrintStream class that prints the result on the console. The max()
          method is a method of the Math class that returns the greater of two
          numbers.
